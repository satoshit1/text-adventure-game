# text-adventure-game
A template for a text based adventure game in Python

This is designed for students learning Python to adapt and extend in order to create their own adventure games.

##Recommended usage:
Provide students with the uncommented version of the program and in pairs they should complete the following tasks:
* Use the Secret Agent Adventure Game.
* Explain how it works by adding comments.
* Modify the game by:
 - Improving the move subprogram so displays a different message if the object is not present in the room.
 - Add more rooms to the adventure.
 - Allow the user to complete the adventure once they have found the plans.
